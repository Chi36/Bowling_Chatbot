# Bowling_Chatbot
Team assignment for final project submission. Frank, Kayla, Harry,  and Trevor all played 9 frames of bowling at Hooplah's. By varying the throw height and speed and collecting data on the number of pins each member hits per throw, we created a chatbot that can help give advice to a user on how to improve their throw.


A detailed explanation of your project. This must include:
Problem Statement: We want to design an app with a user chatbot interface that allows the user to obtain advice on how they can improve their throw for a better score in bowling.
Input and Output Variables: Features (Player, Height, Speed). Targets (Pins hit)
Machine Learning Algorithm(s): After Data preprocessing and EDA were complete,  State the ML techniques or algorithms used and why they were chosen.
Ethics Considerations: Include a link to your completed DataCards and Deon checklist to ensure ethical practices were followed.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): If you developed a GUI, provide a link or screenshots demonstrating its functionality.
Dataset: Clearly specify the dataset used, including its source and any preprocessing steps applied.
