# Bowling_Chatbot
Team assignment for final project submission. Frank, Kayla, Harry,  and Trevor all played 9 frames of bowling at Hooplah's. By varying the throw height and speed and collecting data on the number of pins each member hits per throw, we created a chatbot that can help give advice to a user on how to improve their throw.
